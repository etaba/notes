This letter is to express my interest in applying to the Software Engineering role. With a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering and a hands-on experience using a wide range of languages to create and implement software, I am confident I will be an asset to your organization.

I am passionate about programming. I spend my nights and weekends working on whacky side projects. I maintain 4 personal websites, 2 pypi packages, and am always tinkering on something new. 

I am seeking a role that will let me unleash this creative energy. I want to be challenged and engaged with projects that require me to work outside my comfort zone. I want to learn new things and turn my proficient skills into mastered ones. 

Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills. In addition I would like to add that I have 3+ years of experience working in a highly agile development pattern. I am a a scrum master of a cross-functional team and a seasoned facilitator of the 4 agile events. I have my PSM I scrum master certification.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.
