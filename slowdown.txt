I'm really stoked about the opportunity and the team. Over the weekend I read some more articles about the food prep space and its future, and the company and it got me pretty excited. 

But, just to be transparent, theres one other company im excited for and I owe it to myself to see their onsite through and what they have to offer.

I don't want you to feel like Zume is just a fallback for me, in fact i turned down a competitive offer just this morning. I really like zume, but I just need to see the other process through.

As for the Zumes offer, I really appreciate it as it stands, but in order for it to be really interesting I would want a bump in both base and equity. I'd love to reconnect next week to talk about it further.

I understand my timeleine really isn't ideal and you've already been so generous and leniant, but I will definitely be making a decision by November 9th.
